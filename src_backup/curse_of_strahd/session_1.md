# Session 1 - 08-05-2024

Dear journal,

It all started with ~~a~~ strage dreams...

> An evil tree stands atop a hill.  
> Ravens can help.  
> One of the treasures awaits there.  

> A nest of ravens. There, I find the price...

> The treasure I seek is hidden behind the sun, in the house of a saint.

> I need to find an entertaining man with a monkey. He is more than he seems...

> I see lurking in the darkness, the one place he must return.

I recorded these dreams for posterity, but I have no idea what they mean.

Our story begins, like so many stories, on a stormy night in a crowded tavern.

Songs, games, and chattering fill the tavers main room. Above it sings the famous hobbit boyband "Earth, Wind and Shire," with their hit song "Small Stars."

In the corner, a shady figure discusses vampire weaknesse. At that moment, **Aurellia**, wet from the storm, enters the tavern, and greets her shady companion.

Then, the toilet door opens, and a gnome emerges among green clouds. Drunkely, he stumbles to the bar and orders another one.

A fight starts between drunkards. The barman sends his companion, who throws them out, past Tweed as he enters.

The band ask for a volunteer. Tweed, the only one standing, is chosen, and fails to play along. Luckily, FranXin hands him a lyre, which he fails to play as well.

Then a dark stranger enters the room with a message, and hands it to Aurellia and her companion. The letter reads: _"Save some whore,"_ but more poetic. It is written by <u>the mayor of Barovia</u>.

Tweed and FranXin join, and they take a muddy path to Barovia, after a sceptical challenge from the male mage to Tweed. But then they encounter a thick mist. As they go through it becomes cold, and emerge in a Wintery Barovia.

A German[^1] man fiddles in the bush a bit away. He is surprised by their direction and origin. He claims they can't ever leave, which the male wizard promptly confirms by tring the mist.

The troupe decides to follow the man into a poor cttage. He shares his food, and asks after their origin. This is how we learn that the male wizard is called Kent. He prays to Seluna, the moon goddess. <u>To Aurellia, the man says a healer lives in Vallaky</u>.

Dear diary, I'll tell you:
- Vampires cannot stand sun;
- Live in coffins at day;
- Need to be invited inside;
- Get hurt by <u>flowing</u> water.

The man ~~reinforces~~ shares that only Strahd, the Lord of Barovia, can decide to let them leave from the land.

Then we get expelled from the cottage. Kent wants to take a brake, which we do, and I get the suddent experience that ~~somethin~~ <u>nothing</u> happens explicitly. We arise late in the afternoon.

The happy band ~~s~~ merrily continues to Barovia after a no-shit poop break. The rest of the trip is uneventful, and we enter Barovia.

Two children approach us from the mist. One of them is sobbing, and explains their house is inhabited by a monster. It is supposedly locked in the cellar.

Bravely, we enter the boarded-up house. As we expected, the door closes behind us, and the children have disappeared. Tweed asks Ruby[^2] to find an exit, but to no avail.

We move to the next room, in which a long sword hangs over a hearth. Tweed perce~~ps~~ives it, and discovers it is a long sword but blunt. We takes it along.

~~Aure~~ As Aurellia tries to open the door, but Kent pranks her by casting minor illusion. Aurellia screams in shock, and fumes for the next hour.

We find a crossbow with 10 silver arrows, which Tweed takes along. Kent takes the scalemail, despite it being rusty.

The rowdy revels decide to go t othe dusty but otherwise descent kitchen. There's a good elevator, and a painting. Upon investigation, the painting shows a portret of a pale-skinned man named Drag-ula. He was murdered hundres of years ago in Trans-sylvania.

Divine inspiration reveals we might send gnome-sized characters up with it. Aurellia uses Magicâ„¢ to clean the shaft, which finally convinces Franksin to go in.

After suffering weight-related insults, Frankrin reaches the first floor. He stands in a staff dormatory, and looks around so perceptively he notices its a staff dormitory.

He moves to the second floor, which lands him into the creaky-floored master bedroom of the house. Greedily, he moves towards a jewelbox on the table, filled with expensive gemstones and jewelry. He shares it with the rest of us!

Franksin joins us. Kent plays the ol' letting-go-of-the-rope joke, which causes ~~Ken~~ Franksin to emit some gnomish swear words. Then, the group goes up as a whole, placing ~~V~~Tweed in front.

Various things are in the room they emerge in. As they inspect the room's fung-shway, Franksin wants to check out the neighbouring conservatorium, which they do.

The room is very beautiful. A dusty harp picques Franksin's interest, and, aided by a stool, tries to play it. Culturally, he plays "Hoods-schouders-knie-en-teen."

Moving on, the lads and lass enter the library. Aurellia searches the ~~m~~shelves, but fials a Ctrl+F check. Kent searches the desk and opens a secret door.

A book is revealed, which Aurellia reckognises as complete BS. What does that mean, Diary. Also, a wooden chest stands there, with a dead body pierced with poisoned arrows hanging out of it. It holds a Sealed letter.

The letter reads: "Get F-ed, servant. Love, Strahd." In the accompanied chest, we find money, spell scrolls, directions to a windmill and a will from the parents. The will is signed about 200 years ago.

As we walk back... <span style="font-size: 24pt;">ROLL FOR INITIATIVES!!</span>

One of the armours in the previous room comes to life, and starts attacking us. After a skirmisch, Tweed deals the killing blow, and the armous breaks and disintegrates into rust.

After the victory, the party takes a breather, and continues their track onwards. Yet again, we enter a hallway which some might call a landing, balcony or parade. There is a candle, which literally everybody extinguishes. Nothing happens, except darkness, after which Aurellia re-ignites it.

The leaves in the room make a trail to the wall. It is a secret door to a secret floor! We follow through.

It is covered in dust, cobwebs, and proverbial jack shit. Many doors lead out of the room. After two attempts, the third one sees Tweed lockpicking the room of the children. It contains two child skeletons and a literal baby doll, plus two doll houses, of the windmill and the doll house. Oh yeah, and there are two children ghosts.

The children ghosts explain they starved by neglection. They cannot rest. Then, inspecting the doll house, we find the secret passageways, including the ones to the cellar.

After discussion and almost getting ghost-slapped, the fellowship moves to The Dungeons. In the distance, a ghastly voice says some thing inaudible.

Cautiously, we decide to open the stone tombs. The first one is empty. The second one contains Walter Durst's skeleton. The third contains Daddy Gustov's remains. DM's edit: no there is no Gustav skeleton. The fourth contains insects, of which Ruby[^2] manages to eat one of them. Five and six are empty and belong to the children.

We move to the camnibalist cult's dining room. From there, we try the alcove, but... <span style="font-size: 24pt;">ROLL FOR INITIATIVE!</span>

A slimey, large, beaked-and-tentacled snake presents itself. A short and intense fight ensues, but soon, Aurellia finishes it with a burst of flames. Accidentally, she turns Kent's beautiful hair into a hip assymetrical look.

As we press on, we find ourselves surrounded by moaning ghouls in the next hallway over. The narrow passageways make for a close-quearters fight, but the team manages to defeat the ghouls. It's almost as if they never seem to hit us ~ especially Aurellia with her boob armour.

As a final act of the day, we try to put the children to rest in their respective tombs. It fills us with inspiration as the ghosts fade away, freed from this earth, and we decide to take a short rest afterwards.

Can't wait to see what we do next, dear ~~di~~journal!

Love,  
~~Tweed~~Ruby
