# Session idk 6? - 12-10-2024

Dear journal,

After having killed the evil old crowne that was baking children in her pie, we track back to the Inn in the village. On the way, we successfully resist the temptation of a whisp. Then, in the Inn, the barman is ready to send us to the place of our desire: the Wizard of the Wines.

After consulting with the crows and talking about the possible wines that are expected, we set off to the wine. Nothing can stop us; not a broken-down signpost or the discovery a raven is following is. Kent flirts with a pidgeon in order to distract, but to no avail.

We reach the winefields and enter a scary forest. The weather's violently Scottish all around us. The fog plays on our minds as we reach the wizard. The wizard launches some inappropriate rewards towards Aurelia, although Kent gallantly attempts to shield her physically. He tells us that the farm has been annexed by druids, and that all the magic crystals that make the wine good have been stolen.

Anxious to complete our mission, we head over to the vineyard. When we approach, suddenly, an uncountable hoard of plant monsters suddenly chases us from amongst the wine plants. They chase us to the building, and we don't escape on time - so we're left to fight them off as we run inside.

Tweed runs up the wall and finds himself a target for the needles of the plant monsters. Aurellia blows up the door and storms in, only to find several druids and vine monsters. Outside, Tweed carpet bombs the path with shit and lights it on fire, after scuttling inside. As the rest of the party kills the druid, sadly, no plants are destroyed; they aren't controlled by the druids! But Tweed is on the first floor and finds the Swolstice druid: truly the most jagged druid to ever stomp the Earth. A duel ensues, with his teammates running up the stairs on time to join the battle with the end boss.

Downstairs, Kent is taunting the plants through the ice door casted by Aurellia. Karma strikes and the door breaks; in reply, he bravely ran up the stairs to the rest of the team. There, a team effort (read: Tweed) has just killed the Swolstice, but lo, the twigs and leaves are still afoot! However, Aurellia has the presence of mind to break the swol's staff which finally causes the plants to de-animate. We won the day!
