# Session 2 - ??-??-2024

Wonderful journal,

We rested quickly in the Cannabalist's dining room, ironically enough after fighting off the tsrange ghouls. I wonder what the bite that one of them gave me will turn out to be... I hear cootes.

Kent &amp; Franxin lead the way on deeper to the bottom of the dungeon. The inaudible whisper grows louder, and now audibly says "<u>He</u> is ancient, <u>He</u> is ~~de man~~ the land."

- 
- A dagger in the skull of a rat
- An 8 inch orb/eye from some (eldritch) beast
- A cape
- A ~~slushing~~ gross yellow hand with sharp nails
- A cut finger
- An 8 inch mummy
The last f*ck given by a strange divinits.

Oh journal, the next chamber we managed was absolutely horrid. A huge pile of flesh, bones and human mutier rested in a corner. The rest of the chamber contuined an Altar surrounded by creepy guys. "One must die," -\[I. am. cetrainly. not. here. ha. ha... not a part of this crowd.\]

Kent crudely shoots a gus of frost at one of the cultistsand it just hits the wall behind. They insist one must die.

Three of us eyed Ruby. Contemplating to outplay them. However, no, she's too big of a friend to sacrifice her cutesy fluffy body[^1].

While searching the room, Kent inspects the mound of flesh. The cultists notice we aren't playing along, and start saying in choir: "If none of you will die, all of you will die." <u>Of</u> <u>course</u> the big pile of flesh started moving, hungering for Kent. Why him? He's brainless. Well, better him than us!

<span style="font-size: 24pt;">WE INITIATED IN COMBAT!</span>

A few (quick) notes of the battle:
- Franxin makes the horror laugh?
- The horror tries to skew itself on Kent, whom I will now call the peasant, since the Peasant insulted me after I tried to save him from the meat. Ungrateful twerp... At least Franxin inspired me.
- Tweed (and Ruby!!) are shooting with the crossbow, and then decide t oslice and dice the hunk of rotten meat.
- The Peasant uses one of this \*Incredibly\* useful (cough) silvery barbs. It did not hit, however.
- I cleverly throw my dagger to make it bleed
- Franxin made an ear-whopping clap ->
- The necrotic mound made a weird lively jiggle after. Finding that disgusting, I used burning flames to scorch him. We had him quite far at this point.
- Tweed beutboted to help boost Franxin's confidence to make vulgar "your mother" jokes.
- After the Peasant was thrown at Tweed and Ruby, Franxin's jammies where ruffled, and he lodged the final blow in the horor's core.

The battle ended...

Franxin manages to wake up and stabilize both Tweed and the Peasant.  
Clapping interrupts our moment of respite.

Sir Strahd greets and mocks us, hovering above the murky water. The Peasant tried to stab him, but he got bitch-slapped back hard! Strahd left.  
And, you know what journal, the caves started crumbling! We stormed out as fast as we could, passing unsuspecting shades and combies along the way!

We surely made it out! We vowed to never follow suspicious children again (although I am not too sure myself...). In Barovia, we finally got a well-deserved bath and a semi-luxurious room... Oh, journal, I do sometimes _miss_ my own lodgings back home.

During our downtime we split up.
- I took a great long bath and studied the scroll for 'greese'
- ~~Kent~~ The Peasant went drinking with Franxin.
- Ruby and Tweed stayed in their room. Tweed made sweet remarks to its companion.

I have to say, the scroll was fascinating, and I must confess that I clogged the fascet in the Peasant's room practicing. It worked though!

Afterwards, we all made it downstairs and we were asked by a ~~peasant~~ town fellow to join him. We gave us the cheapest wine, and Franxin managed to swindle the men's own wine bottle.

He tells us he wants us to escort his belowed sister to Vallakie, the same place a possible cure can be found for my mother! We ~~had~~, I mean, I had to go for sure.

We accepted the seques, and we were brought to the mayor's mansion. It was really ~~ugly~~ heavened on the outside. Irene (the man's sister) invited us inside waringly. The mayor laid waiting and dosing in a casket.  
She demans we give him a proper burial.  
For a lady, her demeanour remains somewhat childish.

\[Shopping with the bitches\]

We manage to go to the church.  
A vile scream greets us through the floorboards.  
Again? I believe I've seen enough cellars for a week I believe.  
Peasant, Tweed and Ruby manage to plead and dare to eat sweets! They were way too old.

We encounter the priest, who bluntly lies that his son, who made the scream, is alright. He then admits his son is a minor spawn vampire.

Whilst I thought that we agreed with the team that we would first bury the mayor, Tweed and the Peasant managed to sneak away to try to kill the campire.

Party split -> <span style="font-size: 24pt;">Encounter!</span>

Franxin and I hear the screeches from the celler. We exchanged glances and quickly agreed that he distracted them with a serenade, while I milty stepped out of there. Gracefully tho, because I was getting really uncomfortable after my speech.

I rushed in, and the son immediately lurged at me, then manages to jump to Kent and bite him! His first out of three bites. In retaliation he threw holy water on him.  
Tweed surprised us all, when Franxin walked in, by shooting from the ceiling.

The peasant finished the fight by sticking his rapier through his throat. Tweed reveals he is a Dhampire.

I and the other two are suspicious of Tweed. Ruby... Why haven't you told us??
