# THE CURSE OF STRAHD

Oh dairy... I'll never forget the first adventure I wrote down!! The adventures of our little party as we battled the most fearsome vampire in the land: Strahd.

Yes, what a crazy little family that was... We had:
- Kent: a human-pretending-to-be-elf spellcaster who loves strategy, pranks and killing vampires;
- Aurellia: a human, studious wizard who's totally not Kent's wife;
- Franxin Atra: a goblin with a grand voice and even grander delusions of fame; and
- Tweed Stickles, of course: a human who grew up a little too isolated and method acts hunting vampires.
