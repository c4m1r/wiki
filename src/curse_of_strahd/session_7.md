# Session 7 (probs) - 04-01-2025

Dear diary,

Last night, I had very strange dreams. They featured some green and pink blobs featuring a lot of poo jokes? Very odd...

~~Kent~~ Anyway, we find ourselves amidst plant corpses in the vineyard of the Wizard of the Wines. Kent finds one druid who is (barely) alive, and interrogates him in a US-approved manner. However, Aurellia and Franksin stage an alcoholic intervention, and the druid dies peacefully.

We search through hteh ouse, and find a wineshipment admin book. In it, we find that the following places received some:
- BV
- BW (Blue Water Inn, Vallakie)
- K
- V(istadie)
- S(trahd)

~~Whi~~ Preparing to go to the cellar, we run some numbmers to find how much wine we can carry along. After some bickering, suddenly, a white light shines outside, and a cart has appeared! How convenient.

In the cellar, we find a lot of wine and dead wrights. As Kent smells something stale, the Wizard of the Wine's voice calls upstairs. We meet him with our arms full of wine,which pleases the old twig as he thinks we are preparing the first Valakie shipment. He sends his two ~~prostitutes~~ escorts along with us, and we set off.

We are ~~receivend~~ received in Valakie as heroes. Even more so when Kent cracks open a cold one (a barrell), and a great celebration ensues.

We arrive at Ervin, and discover that his whole family ~~is~~ are were-ravens, representating the official Strahd Resistance Front (not to be confused with the Front of Strahd Resistance). Happy with our progress, he reveals the restistance's secret weapon: the Tome of Strahd. We get to read (it reads as a very self-indulgent rap and then diary), and catch a glimpse of Strahd's ~~gossip~~ inner mind. It speaks of jealousy and family feuds, friendzone and rejection, and talks of his love interest casting herself of a cliff. Rather sad! But we also learn:
- Katiana ~~looks~~ (love interest) looks and awful lot like Irena!
- Wooden stakes incapacitate vampires;
- Higher-level vampires respawn at their resting places (Strahd's unknown);
- There is a sword mentioned in the story.

Back in the tavern, we join the party, and achieve various states of intoxication. Inebriated, Franxin bursts into a song, singing of our most recent exploits at the vineyard. The lyrics are truly moving, and the crowd goes wild. Besides the incredible adoration, it earns Franxin a beer, and he gulps it down in deserved satisfaction.

As the evening continues, Tweed is ~~approve~~ approached by an orc. He offers him an invitation to the Wagter's House, where his mother wants to talk to us. A little apprehensive, Tweed accepts the card and saves it for later.

The party lasts all night. When we come to the next morning, we decide to clean our sins at the nearest church. It is crowded with filthy, frightened peasants (look at them). Their shepherd tells us they are upset because the bones of St. Andral have been stolen; and interrogation of a heart, gravedigger reveals he learned this and passed on the words to a chap called Hendrik (coffinmaker). Deciding to help the poor, we head to Hendrik's shop to investigate.

The shop is boarded up. We hatch a plan where Aurellia and Franxin try knocking on the front door and getting in by persuading him with the word of Christ and tiddies. Meanwhile, Kent and Tweed burglar their way through the back door. Both are successfull. As the jehova's Sluts continue to work their magic on the unsuspecting carpenter, Tweed and Kent investigate for the bones. Unfortunately, they choose the wrong door, and end up in the room with Hendrik. Their stealth seems lost, until Aurellia employs the stock-in-a-coffic-stepcarpenter-gambit, distracting him long enough for the burglars to retreat.

The burglars check upstairs. Meanwhile, the sluts have success, and trick the man in confessing he has the bones and that they are in a chest with "junk" on it on the top floor. Telepathically, Aurellia feeds this to the burglars, who quite arbitrarily decide to open chest #5 of 5 applicable. And then, they find the bones! Kidding, of course, they don't, they find a mirror vampire spawn instead. <span style="font-size: 24pt;"><i>Roll for initiative...</i></span>

Kent and Tweed make short work of the spawn. Checking out the commotion, Hendrik, Aurellia and Franxin come up. They all convince the man they are there to help, but still need to find the bones, so they try crates in turn. The first crate, they attack ~~the~~ first, killing the spawn first. Then they kill junk. Finally, they kill the last spawn. Then we find the bones!

We take them back to the Father. He's ripped, and did so many pushups his voice changed. After minor nudging by Franxin, he shares with us the location of the Abbey of St. Marcovia, as a thank you.

Having saved the church, we progress to the Versani camp. We find quite the scene: two brothers are whipping a boy ~~who has~~. He's being punished for losing his eye on the chieftains daughter. Luckily, she's been returned already - by us! To prove that, we are reunited with her, and it becomes canon that Aurellia is a man.

The chieftain wants to reward us by offering a choice of the contents of one of the six carts. Using the amazing illusion of a stationary, static, flying horse by Kent, Tweed peeks in a cart and sees a wooden chest. They choose another one, and find the chieftain's throne! But he doesn't want to ~~return~~ give it away. So instead, he buys it back from us for 250GP and a mystery item, the latter which turns out to be 9 cheap jewerly and 1 expensive one.

Around the camp, a circle of houses stands. In front of one of them, three elves sit. Kent talks to them in Elvish, which none others can understand. Afterwards, we learn through Kent that they are basically genocided and this is a concentration camp :'( He also tells us of the Amber Templ, which contains the pact related to defeating Strahd and liberating Barovia. or so it is rumoured.

The elf has a wish to resurrect his dead daughter, and as such, he can accompany us to the temple. We accept his offer for when we go there. Then, we immediately head for the inn and go to play cards.

Just before our bed time, 9 PM, panic outside ensues. It turns out to be two were-bats and lots of regular ones. We give chase, and follow them to an abandoned curch. Ruby[^1] goes undercover, and finds out it may be a trap. But they have us at the ~~metaph~~ moral balls, so we go in anyway.

<span style="font-size: 24pt;">Roll for initiative!</span>

The battle is tough. The were-bats are easily taken care of, but the swarm of bats turns out to be Zinera, the Terror Valakie! And not only that, she is the one who terrorized both Tweed and Kent's families when they were young.

After many illusions, biting and radient attacks, Tweed finishes her off with a vengeful sword to the face. But instead of killing her, she explodes in a puff of mist, which ~~two~~ the words: "I'll be baaaaack!" echoing around her.

Dear diary, that was a tricky battle and adventurous session. But we're not done yet. We'll be back...

Love,  
<u>Ruby</u>
