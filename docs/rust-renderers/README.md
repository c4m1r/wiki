# Rust Renderers

Rust is well suited for building fast and safe graphics pipelines. Several libraries make it easier to create 2D and 3D applications as well as user interfaces.

## Why Use Rust for Rendering?

- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- Good cross-platform support.
- Growing ecosystem for both native and web-based graphics.

## Planned Articles

1. Getting started with `wgpu` for cross-platform GPU access.
2. Building small games with `Bevy` or `Macroquad`.
3. Creating user interfaces using `egui` or `iced`.
4. Packaging applications for the web with WebAssembly.

These sections will expand over time with code samples and integration tips.
