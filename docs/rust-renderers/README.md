# Rust Renderers

Rust is well suited for building fast and safe graphics pipelines. Several libraries make it easier to create 2D and 3D applications as well as user interfaces.

## Why Use Rust for Rendering?

- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- Good cross-platform support.
- Growing ecosystem for both native and web-based graphics.

## Topics to Explore

- `wgpu` for modern GPU access across Vulkan, Metal, and DirectX.
- Game engines such as `Bevy` or `Macroquad`.
- Immediateâ€‘mode GUI libraries like `egui` and `iced`.
- Building WebAssembly targets to run in the browser.

Future articles will dive deeper into these libraries and show how to integrate them into interactive projects.
